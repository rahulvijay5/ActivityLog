🚀 12 Skills in 12 Months - Activity Log

Welcome to my 12 Skills in 12 Months challenge! In this repository, I document my daily learning process as I dive into tech, business, and AI. Each month, I focus on mastering one skill, and I’m starting with App Development for the first month.

📅 Month 1: App Development with React Native & Expo
For Month 1, I’m kicking things off with mobile app development. My goal is to get comfortable with building apps using React Native and Expo — two powerful tools that make cross-platform mobile development easier.

I’ll be diving into:

React Native: Building user interfaces for mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
Expo: A framework that simplifies development with React Native, enabling faster workflows and easier app deployment.
📖 What You’ll Find in This Repo:
