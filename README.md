## 🚀 12 Skills in 12 Months - Activity Log

Welcome to my 12 Skills in 12 Months challenge! In this repository, I document my daily learning process as I dive into tech, business, and AI. Each month, I focus on mastering one skill, and I’m starting with App Development for the first month.

### 📅 Month 1: App Development with React Native & Expo
For Month 1, I’m kicking things off with mobile app development. My goal is to get comfortable with building apps using React Native and Expo — two powerful tools that make cross-platform mobile development easier.

### 🎯 Why Follow Along?
I believe in 1% improvement every day — small, consistent progress is what matters. By tracking my journey here, I stay motivated and reflect on my growth. Whether you’re interested in app development, React Native, or just learning something new, feel free to follow along!


### 📚 Why App Development for Month 1?
Because I would be having the abilities to create my own app later on.

### 📈 What’s in Store for Month 1?
Goal: By the end of the month, I aim to build a fully functional mobile app, and in meanwhile many learnings.
End Deliverable: A cross-platform app ready for deployment.

If you have any recommended resources, feel free to make me know of them!

### 📝 Tracking Growth:
Each day, I’ll update this repository with:
