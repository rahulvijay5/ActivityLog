# ðŸ“… Daily Activity Log - Day [4-5]  
### Date: 4-5 January'25  

## âœ… What was done on Day 4 & 5:  
- Worked on full-stack authentication using Clerk for both web and app platforms.  
- Set up a new project, starting with the web version and planning to extend it to mobile.  
- Configured `hono` with Prisma for Cloudflare Workers and PostgreSQL integration.  
- Designed and implemented UI for home, sign-in, and sign-up pages.  
- Explored open-source repositories for inspiration and learning.  
- Learned about TurboRepo to potentially unify the DB, web, and app into a single repo and how I can use that a bit.

## ðŸ“š What I learned:  
- Clerk authentication for seamless user management across platforms.  
- Setting up Prisma with Hono for Cloudflare Workers using [this resource](https://hono.dev/examples/prisma).  
- API sharing between web and app platforms using Next.js routes and Cloudflare Workers.
- The importance of TurboRepo in managing mono-repos for full-stack development.  

## ðŸŽ¯ What I will do tomorrow:  
- Continue refining the authentication and API setup.  
- Start integrating advanced backend features.  
- Experiment with TurboRepo for streamlining development.(if time persists)

Or,
- I did get to know that I am week with OOPs and its practical use case, so will try to give my time on it, so that I can practice that more, for future use case.
