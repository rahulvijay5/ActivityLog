# ðŸ“… Daily Activity Log - Day [3]  
### Date: 3 January'25  

## âœ… What was done today:  
- Explored the amazing components and libraries Expo provides:  
  - Camera  
  - Accelerometers  
  - Haptics  
  - Location  
  - Pedometer, and alot more!  
- Learned how these are integrated into applications and can be used in our own apps.  
- Started learning full-stack app development following [JS Masteryâ€™s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCUegTZF7M).  
- Discovered how React Native components complement Expo, like implementing swappable navigation with React Navigation's [Material Top Tab Navigator](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/material-top-tab-navigator/).  

## ðŸ“š What I learned today:  
- Expo SDK is a powerhouse for app features; full documentation available [here](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/expo/).  
- React Native provides additional components not directly covered in Expo, like material top tabs for swappable navigation.  
- Full-stack app development combines frontend and backend in one cohesive application (first time learning this term!).  

## ðŸŽ¯ What I will do tomorrow:  
- Continue building and learning full-stack app development.  
- Deep dive into implementing backend APIs and databases with React Native apps.  
- Explore advanced navigation techniques.
