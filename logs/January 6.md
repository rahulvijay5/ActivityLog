## ðŸ“š What I learned today:  
- JavaScript classes make organizing and managing code easier for larger projects:  
- Deployment involves much more than just writing codeâ€”scaling, containerization, and infrastructure management require significant effort.
- Learned about socket connections and their basic implementation.
- Watched a YouTube live session by Harkirat Singh on deployment, containerization, scaling, and production:  
  - Realized the depth of knowledge required for deploying projects.  
  - Understood the challenges of taking projects to production.
