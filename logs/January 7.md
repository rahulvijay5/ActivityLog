# ðŸ“… Daily Activity Log - Day [7]  
### Date: 7 January'25  

## âœ… What was done today:  
- Almost the Roulette program, and it's now fully functional, the frontend and the backend. 
- Learned about JavaScript classes while building the programâ€”implementing them was fun and insightful.  
- Gained deeper knowledge of WebSocket connections:  
  - Learned their flow, implementation, and use cases.  
- Realized that scaling the current project with user data, authentication, and more features is possible, but itâ€™s sufficient for now.  
- Recognized that the socket connection knowledge will be crucial for future app ideas.  

## ðŸ“š What I learned today:  
- JavaScript classes and their practical implementations.  
- WebSocket connection flow and functionality for real-time communication.  
- Benefits of using monorepos for managing apps, web, and backend in a single repository.  

## ðŸŽ¯ What I will do tomorrow:  
- Decide whether to enhance the Roulette program or start a new app idea.  
- Focus on learning about monorepos to streamline future projects.  
- Continue building on mobile authentication, database connections, and UI.
